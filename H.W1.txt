<div> and <section>:

    <div> :
        The <div> element is a generic container used to group together related elements or to divide a webpage into sections for styling purposes.
        It doesn't convey any specific meaning or semantics to search engines or assistive technologies.
        It's typically used when there isn't a more appropriate semantic element available.

    <section>:
        The <section> element is used to define a thematic grouping of content, typically representing a section of a document or webpage.
        It's often used to organize related content and give it a meaningful structure(Such as the comments section, latest articles, etc).
        <section> elements are semantically meaningful, providing context to search engines and assistive technologies.

<div> is a generic container for grouping content, while <section> is a semantic element used to represent thematic groupings of content within a document.
Choosing between them depends on the specific meaning and purpose of the content you're structuring.

<p> and <article>:

    <p>:
        The <p> tag is used to define a paragraph of text.
        It is typically used for blocks of text content.
        It is inline-level content, meaning it flows with the surrounding text.
        It does not inherently carry any semantic meaning beyond denoting a paragraph.

    <article>:
        The <article> tag is used to define an independent, self-contained piece of content.
        It represents a complete composition in a document, such as a blog post, newspaper article, forum post, etc.
        It can include other elements like headings, paragraphs, images, etc., that collectively form a standalone piece of content.
        It is a block-level element, meaning it typically creates a block of content that starts on a new line and fills the width of its container.

<p> is used for individual paragraphs within content, while <article> is used for larger, standalone content pieces that may contain multiple paragraphs 
and other elements.
